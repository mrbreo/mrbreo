Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Iâ€™m deeply passionate about shaping the future of technology, where decentralization, artificial intelligence, and intuitive user interfaces converge to create groundbreaking solutions. My expertise lies at the intersection of ai/ml, full stack, and decentralized network.

I have participated in the International Collegiate Programming Contest (ICPC) and International Mathematical Olympiad (IMO), reflecting my strong problem-solving skills and analytical mindset.
